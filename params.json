{"name":"Dryrun-php","tagline":"Quickly try the demo project of any Android Library written in PHP","body":"# dryrun in PHP (JUST FOR FUN)\r\n\r\nThis is complete PHP Port of orginal ruby version [dryrun](https://github.com/cesarferreira/dryrun) by [cesarferreira](https://github.com/cesarferreira)\r\n\r\n>Did this as a fun project :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :smirk: \r\n\r\n**Try** any **android library** on your **smartphone** **directly** from the **command line**\r\n\r\n> A dry run is a testing process where the effects of a possible failure are intentionally mitigated. For example, an aerospace company may conduct a \"dry run\" test of a jet's new pilot ejection seat while the jet is parked on the ground, rather than while it is in flight.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesarferreira/dryrun/master/extras/usage.gif\" width=\"100%\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n> dryrun https://github.com/cesarferreira/android-helloworld\r\n\r\n\r\nWait a few seconds... and `voilÃ `! The app is opened on your phone :smiley:\r\n\r\n### Goodies\r\n\r\n- Private repos can be tested too :smiley:\r\n\r\n  - assuming that you have the corresponding `private ssh keys` in your `~./ssh/`\r\n\r\n  - > $ dryrun git@github.com:cesarferreira/android-helloworld.git\r\n\r\n- No need to cleanup after you test the library.\r\n  - Your operating system will clean the /tmp/ folder for you.\r\n\r\n- No need to wait for **Android Studio** to load.\r\n\r\n## Alternative scenario (if you don't use `dryrun`)\r\n\r\n1. Find the github's repository url\r\n2. Click the `download zip`\r\n3. Extract the `zip file`\r\n4. Open Android Studio\r\n5. Import the project you just downloaded\r\n6. Sync gradle\r\n7. Run the project\r\n8. Choose the device you want to run\r\n9. Test all you want\r\n10. Delete the `project folder` and the `zip file` when you don't want it anymore\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n    $ wget http://sunel.github.io/dryrun.phar -O dryrun\r\n```\r\nOR\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n    $ curl http://sunel.github.io/dryrun.phar -O dryrun\r\n```\r\nthen \r\n\r\n```shell\r\n\t$ sudo chmod a+x dryrun\r\n\t$ sudo mv dryrun /usr/local/bin/dryrun\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Requirements `(if you haven't already)`:**\r\n\r\n> $ANDROID_HOME defined on the environment variables [(how-to)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5526470/trying-to-add-adb-to-path-variable-osx)\r\n\r\n\r\n> Android SDK in your $PATH [(how-to)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19986214/setting-android-home-enviromental-variable-on-mac-os-x)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/sunel/DryRun-PHP.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
